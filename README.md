Makiwara
========
A "makiwara" is a padded striking post used in karate training. It allows students of karate to practice and hone their skills. I created this repository, and this README to help encourage other programmers to who practice their software design skills.

I would be remiss not to acknowledge the concept of [CodeKata](http://codekata.pragprog.com/) by [Dave Thomas](http://pragdave.pragprog.com/), one of the authors of [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer). In Dave's [background article on CodeKata](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/code_kata_backg.html#more) he outlines a series of short programming exercises. I strongly recommend doing these an other CodeKata practice sessions that you come across.
