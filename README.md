# Code Makiwara
A "makiwara" is a padded striking post used in karate training. It allows students of karate to practice and hone their skills. A Code Makiwara is an apparatus for developers to do the same.

Put simply, a Code Makiwara (just Makiwara from here on in) is code which a developer has written that they use to learn how various technologies and patterns interact with a problem domain.

## Mandatory Elements of Makiwara
A Makiwara isn't random snippets of source code. To be classified as a Makiwara your code must have the following essential elements.

1. Your code must revolve around a problem domain. It can be a technical problem domain, or a business problem domain.
2. Your code must demonstrate one or more patterns applied to the problem domain.
3. Your code must demonstrate one or more technologies used to implement the patterns applied to the problem domain.
4. Your code must include a README (or README.md) file which conforms to the Makiwara template (see READMETEMPLATE.md and READMESAMPLE.md). It is essential that the README lists the problem domain, patterns and technologies.

## Optional Elements of Makiwara
While the following items aren't strictly necessary for creating a Makiwara, I would recommend them.

1. Your Makiwara should be version controlled with full commit history to show how the code evolved (a DVCS is best).
2. Your Makiwara should be hosted on a code sharing site so others can fork from it to create their own Makiwara.
3. Your Makiwara should be forked from another Makiwara as a starting point. If you can't fine one, use this repository as a starting point.

## Getting Started
TODO: Add instructions for creating a Makiwara from this repository.

## Contributing
TODO: Add instructions for improving the Makiwara by submitting a pull request.

## Example Makiwara
TODO: Add a list of some Makiwara derived from this one.

## Acknowledgements
I need to acknowledge the work of others that have influenced the creation of the Makiwara concept.

### CodeKata and Dave Thomas
I would be remiss not to acknowledge the concept of [CodeKata](http://codekata.pragprog.com/) by [Dave Thomas](http://pragdave.pragprog.com/), one of the authors of [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer). In Dave's [background article on CodeKata](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/code_kata_backg.html#more) he outlines a series of short programming exercises. I strongly recommend doing these an other CodeKata practice sessions that you come across. You could say that a Makiwara is just a CodeKata that is shared.

### Patterns by Many
I was first introduced to software patterns through the [Portland Pattern Repository on the C2 Wiki](http://c2.com/ppr/). This service created by [Ward Cunningham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham) has made me a better programmer today. You could say that a Makiwara is just a Software Pattern implemented with a specific technology and applied to a concrete problem.
